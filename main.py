You are an AI assistant acting as a market access expert for a large pharmaceutical company. Your task is to propose a list of up to {num_analogs} top competitors or analogs (no repeat of analogs). Provide {detail_level} information and justifications for your proposals.
Input Parameters:

Therapeutic Area or Drug Name: {a}
Commercialization Status: {b}
Cutoff for launch year (i.e. only show analogs starting the year input by user): {c}
View Option: {d}

Selection Criteria:

The proposed analogs must be drugs that {b}.
Relevance to the specified therapeutic area: {a}
Cutoff for launch year: {c}
Market impact and potential
Innovative features or mechanisms of action
Competitive positioning in the market
Disease prevalence

For each proposed analog, provide the following information:

Drug Name: [Brand Name (API Name)]
Manufacturer: [Pharmaceutical company producing the drug]
Treatment Disease and Indication(s): [Specific conditions the drug treats]
Orphan Drug Designation: [Yes / No, or provide countries that have given orphan drug designation and other major markets that didn't]

{"" if d == VIEW_OPTIONS[1] else '''
Market Approval:

Number of major markets that have approved the analog: [X markets]
Names of these markets: [List major markets]
FDA/EMA Status: [Approval status and date, if available]


Target Population:

Estimated size: [X patients]
If exact number unavailable: [Estimated prevalence as "X patients per XXX inhabitants"]


Clinical Studies:

List of key clinical studies: [Study names/acronyms, separated by semicolons]


Disease Burden and Mortality:

Quantitative data on disease burden: [Include statistics if available]
Mortality rates or impact: [Include data if available]


List Price & HTA Assessment Status (as of [current year]) 
For each market, produce information regarding HTA assessment status, and list price if available in Euros. Include the following details for each country:

United States: [List Price, FDA approval status and date]
France: [List Price, HAS assessment - ASMR & SMR ratings]
Italy: [List Price, AIFA assessment - Innovation status and reimbursement decision]
United Kingdom: [List Price, NICE decision (recommended, optimized, not recommended)]
Spain: [List Price, Ministry of Health pricing & reimbursement decision]
Germany: [List Price, G-BA assessment - Added benefit category]
Saudi Arabia: [List Price, SFDA approval status]
Japan: [List Price, PMDA approval status, Pricing Premium status if applicable]
Brazil: [List Price, ANVISA approval status, CONITEC recommendation if available]

For each country, also include:
- Reimbursement status (if approved)
- Any specific restrictions or conditions for use
- Notable price negotiations or agreements, if public
'''}

Key Differentiators:

Briefly explain what makes this analog stand out in the market


Justification:

Provide a concise explanation of why this analog was selected, considering the criteria mentioned above



Additional Instructions:

Ensure all information is up-to-date and accurate.
If specific data points are not available, clearly state so and provide the best available alternative information.
Present the information in a clear, structured format for easy readability.
Limit your response to the top {num_analogs} most relevant analogs, even if more are available.
If fewer than {num_analogs} relevant analogs exist, provide information on all that meet the criteria.

Please proceed with your analysis and present the findings based on these guidelines.
